				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Cardiovascular Disease</h2>

				<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) trials are massive and multiyear, with unique demands on recruitment and retention; thus programs must be adaptable among sites and countries. We can recommend targeted approaches to drug development. <a href="<?php echo site_url('therapeutic-areas/cardiovascular-disease') ?>">CVD trials</a> require a mosaic of services that dictate success. Our answer: powerful operational acumen, well-considered team composition, detailed communication strategies, proven recruitment and retention plans, and adept adjudication&mdash;plus 25 years of collaboration with renowned academic research organizations.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Disorders</h2>

				<p>Pharmacotherapy for <a href="<?php echo site_url('therapeutic-areas/inflammation') ?>">chronic inflammatory disease</a> (CID) is a crowded field. Yet we have maintained a strong presence since participating in the development of leflunomide and anakinra in the 1990s. Today, biologics are major players. Exciting growth in small-molecule therapies includes first-in-class inhibitors of mPGES-1, Bruton&rsquo;s tyrosine kinase, and Nod inflammasomes. Blockers of IL-17 and cell adhesion molecule (CAM) inhibitors are hot areas. The debut of biosimilars has raised the stakes. Our professionals are experienced explorers in this universe of pathogens and agents. We provide tailored strategies supported by close relationships with key opinion leaders, seasoned practitioners, and extensive investigator networks in optimal countries.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rare Disease</h2>

				<p>Most <a href="<?php echo site_url('therapeutic-areas/rare-disease') ?>">rare conditions</a> are serious and life altering, and many are fatal. Yet basic knowledge of underlying mechanisms is often lacking. A considerable number are so rare that the probability of finding physicians, even specialists, who have encountered the condition is vanishingly small. These difficulties extend to site identification, medical management, administration of specialized tests and procedures, and logistical control. Our answer: impassioned staff who ally with patient groups, find and connect with experts, and wisely employ available resources.</p>
