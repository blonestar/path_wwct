# The To-Do List

### Priority
* Add support for ajax enabled forms.
* Add support for more, if not all, field types.
* Make form data exporting better.
* Find another way to store repeated field data during validation so that postCapture dependency is not necessary.
* Make fields use their own functions for validation and possibly for data fetching/formatting.
* Allow zero repeat count.

### Possibly
* Localize repeater php data so that sending it via a serialized array inside of a hidden field is not necessary.
* ^ After that, remove the need to loop through fields to get repeater children via javascript.
